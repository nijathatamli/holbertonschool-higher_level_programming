## Overview

This repository focuses on **higher-level programming concepts**, including but not limited to:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
* Advanced data structures and algorithms
* File I/O and exception handling
* API integration and networking
* Modular and reusable code design

The goal is to prepare students for real-world programming projects and more advanced computer science topics.

## Features

* Python scripts demonstrating advanced programming concepts
* Exercises on OOP, data structures, and algorithms
* Projects that integrate multiple programming skills
* Clear examples and well-documented code

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nijathatamli/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Navigate to the folder of a specific project or exercise and run the Python scripts directly. For example:

```bash
python3 example_script.py
```

Follow the instructions in each exercise to complete the tasks and test the scripts.
