# Python – More Classes and Objects

This project continues exploring **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
You will deepen your understanding of classes, instances, attributes, encapsulation, methods, and Pythonic conventions for writing maintainable OOP code.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to clearly explain the following concepts without using Google:

### 🧱 Core OOP Concepts

- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is  
- What “first-class everything” means in Python  
- What a class is  
- What an object and an instance are  
- Difference between a class and an instance/object  

### 🔧 Attributes & Encapsulation

- What an attribute is  
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes  
- What `self` is and how it works  
- What Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding mean  

### 🏗 Methods & Special Methods

- What a method is  
- The special `__init__` method and how to use it  
- The difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`  
- How to implement meaningful string representations for objects  

### 🧬 Properties & Pythonic Getters/Setters

- What a property is  
- Difference between an attribute and a property  
- How to write Pythonic getters and setters using `@property`  
- Why Python prefers public attributes over strict getters/setters  

### 🏛 Class vs Instance Attributes

- What a class attribute is  
- Difference between object attributes and class attributes  
- How attributes are bound to instances or classes  

### 🧠 Advanced Class Features

- What `__dict__` contains for a class and for an instance  
- How Python finds attributes (attribute resolution order)  
- How to dynamically add new attributes to an existing instance  
- How to use the built-in `getattr()` function  

### 🧰 Class & Static Methods

- What a class method is (`@classmethod`)  
- What a static method is (`@staticmethod`)  
- Appropriate use cases for each
