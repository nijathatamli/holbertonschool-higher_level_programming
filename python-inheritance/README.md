# Inheritance in Python

## Description
Inheritance is an object–oriented programming feature that allows a class to derive
attributes and methods from another class.  
The class that is inherited from is called the **base (parent) class**, and the class
that inherits is called the **subclass (child class)**.

## Why Inheritance?
- Reuse existing code  
- Extend or modify parent behavior  
- Avoid duplication  
- Create logical class hierarchies  

## Basic Syntax
```python
class Parent:
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass
